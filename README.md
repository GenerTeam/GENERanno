# GENERanno

Welcome to the Gener Series!

In this repository, we present GENERanno, a genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 8k base pairs and 500M parameters, trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386 billion base pairs of eukaryotic DNA. The extensive and diverse pre-training data endow the GENERanno with enhanced capabilities in deciphering DNA semantics across various organisms. Our evaluations demonstrate that the GENERator consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide spectrum of benchmarks, including [Genomic Benchmarks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/katielink/genomic-benchmarks/tree/main), [NT tasks](https://huggingface.co/datasets/InstaDeepAI/nucleotide_transformer_downstream_tasks_revised), and our newly proposed [Gener tasks](https://huggingface.co/GenerTeam). 

Beyond benchmark performance, the GENERanno model is meticulously designed with its specialization in gene annotation. The model efficiently and accurately identifies gene locations, predicts gene function, and annotates gene structure, highlighting its potential to revolutionize genomic research by significantly enhancing the precision and efficiency of gene annotation processes.

Please note that the GENERanno is currently in the developmental phase. We are actively refining the model and will release more technical details soon. Stay tuned for updates!
